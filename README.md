- login.php         : Main login page for both staff and technician.
- report.php        : Form page for staff to report IT issues.
- submit.php        : Server-side script to handle form submission and insert into MySQL.
- thank-you.html    : Confirmation page after successful report submission.
- jobs.php          : Technician view to see incomplete or complete jobs.
- update.php        : Endpoint for technicians to mark jobs as complete.
- db.php            : Database connection script.
- styles.css        : External CSS stylesheet for consistent UI.
- validation.js     : JavaScript form validation (client-side).
- wearview_support.sql : MySQL schema to set up the database.
